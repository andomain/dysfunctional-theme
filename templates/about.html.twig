					<p>Away from the glorious tedium that is pushing pens in the pursuit of saving witless and disinterested from themselves, I've sought out the heady heights of middle class adventures.</p>
					<p>I've stood on the shoulders of lesser giants, trespassed into  the realm of moderate but easily managed danger, chased tame dragons around the long corners of the night and demonstrated extreme caution as I've run away from bears.</p>
					<p>Most of what I pass off as creativity is the product of an inability to follow a recipe as closely as the author originally intended.</p>
